## What are ambassadors?

Ambassadors are individuals that have been accepted to promote the Stanford One For the World message and encourage others to take the pledge.

## What are the perks of being an ambassador?

Being an ambassador means being a part of the OFTW community. This includes the ability to attend exclusive ambassador events, which range from networking events (both with undergrads with similar interests and students from other graduate schools) to fun picnics, hikes, and movie events.

Ambassadors will also be featured on our website, either as a club ambassador, dorm ambassador or a general ambassador (see below).

## How do I become an ambassador?

Ambassadors simply need to complete these three simple tasks to become ambassadors.

1. Attend an ambassador training workshop. (Coming soon -- [follow us](https://eepurl.com/haZea1) to stay in touch!)
2. [Take the pledge](/pledge/) and get three friends to take the pledge.

  <summary>Club Ambassadors</summary>
  
  Club ambassadors are responsible for bringing Stanford OFTW to a Stanford organization which they are a part of. Many clubs allow a specific leadership position for “One For the World” coordinator, check with your club if this is a possibility. Club ambassadors will facilitate OFTW competitions and will try to get as much of their club to take the pledge as possible. Club ambassadors will be featured on a special portion of the website.

  Dorm ambassadors are responsible for bringing Stanford OFTW to their dorm. Ask your RA how you can become a dorm ambassador. Freshmen dorm ambassadors are often closely affiliated with Frosh Service Liaisons.

  <summary>Club & Dorm Competitions</summary>

  <p>Club ambassadors facilitate club competitions that occur during OFTW’s pledge week. Whichever club member can get the most other individuals outside the club to sign up wins a prize (determined by the club and the OFTW event coordinator - currently Carolyn Ky) and is also featured on the OFTW website. </p>
  
  <p>Also during pledge week is an all-organization competition: whichever club and dorm (of 10+ members) has the greatest percentage of its members take the pledge gets a prize (determined by the OFTW events coordinator - currently Carolyn Ky).</p>
