    <p>All charities are important. But did you know that some are <strong class="blue">10,000 times more
        effective</strong> at using your dollars than
      others?</p>

    <p><strong class="darkblue">One for the World</strong> donates to the <span class="highlight">most</span> effective
      charities... the ones that
      <strong>save a
        life</strong> for between $900 and $7,000
      through <span class="malaria darkgreen">ðŸ¦  fighting malaria</span> or <span class="deworming darkred">ðŸª±
        deworming young children</span>.</p>

    <p>The pledge is <strong class="one green">1%</strong> of what you expect your annual income to be upon graduation
      to
      your choice of <strong class="green">16 charities</strong>.</p>

    <p>You can change the <span class="green">amount of money pledged</span>, the <span class="red">date of
        transaction</span>, <span class="darkblue">and the charities</span> at any time. You can also
      cancel your donation. The only thing you need to take the pledge is a credit card.</p>
