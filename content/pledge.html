  <p>All charities are important. But did you know that some are <strong class="blue">10,000 times more
      effective</strong> at using your dollars than
    others?</p>

  <p><strong class="darkblue">One for the World</strong> donates to the <span class="highlight">most</span> effective
    charities... the ones that
    <strong>save a
      life</strong> for between $900 and $7,000
    through <span class="malaria darkgreen">ðŸ¦  fighting malaria</span> or <span class="deworming darkred">ðŸª±
      deworming young children</span>.</p>

  <p class="charity-info darkblue">Click <a href="">here</a> for more info on charities.</p>

  <p>The pledge is <strong class="one green">1%</strong> of what you expect your annual income to be upon graduation to
    your choice of <strong class="green">16 charities</strong>.</p>

  <p>You can change the <span class="green">amount of money pledged</span>, the <span class="red">date of
      transaction</span>, <span class="darkblue">and the charities</span> at any time. You can also
    cancel your donation. The only thing you need to take the pledge is a credit card.</p>

  <p>Remember: this may be your <strong>GREATEST</strong> chance to have a tangible positive impact in your undergrad
    career. With your
    small contribution, you could save dozens from malaria, lift families out of poverty for good, and preserve the
    sight of dozens of children. Anyone who could help the world that much would be a hero. <strong>Now you can be,
      too.</strong></p>
