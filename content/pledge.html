  <p>All charities are important. But did you know that some are 10,000 times more effective at using your dollars than
    others?</p>

  <p>One for the World donates to the most effective charities... the ones that save a life for between $900 and $7,000
    through fighting malaria or deworming young children.</p>

  <p>Click here for more info on charities.</p>

  <p>The pledge is 1% of what you expect your annual income to be upon graduation to your choice of 16 charities.</p>

  <p>You can change the amount of money pledged, the date of transaction, and the charities at any time. You can also
    cancel your donation. The only thing required to take the pledge is your credit card information.</p>

  <p>Remember this may be your GREATEST chance to have a tangible positive impact in your undergrad career.</p>
